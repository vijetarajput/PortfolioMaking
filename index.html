                        Fermented milk in India is a reflection of the culture, traditions, and food habits of this
                        country.
                        They form an
                        integral part of the daily meal of the people of India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and some
                        neighboring
                        countries. Among the
                        various fermented milk products, dahi, a lactic fermented milk product, is considered one of the
                        oldest and widely
                        consumed. It has a very close resemblance to yogurt and is popular by different names in
                        different
                        parts of India. Dahi
                        is consumed as such or with the addition of sugar or salt. It is a nutritiously balanced food
                        containing almost all the
                        nutrients present in milk but in a more assimilable form. Its quality and shelf-life are largely
                        defined by the type and
                        quality of milk, quality and kind of starter culture used, and processing parameters such as
                        heat
                        treatment, incubation
                        conditions, type of packaging, and storage conditions. It forms the base for the preparation of
                        a
                        number of other
                        fermented products such as lassi, chhach, and shrikhand. Dahi and its related products are well
                        recognized for their
                        therapeutic properties, particularly in curing gastrointestinal disorders. Dahi has a number of
                        nonfood applications
                        related to traditional customs and beliefs. Additionally, it has been recognized for its
                        cosmetic
                        applications. The
                        production of dahi and its related products is still largely confined to the unorganized Indian
                        dairy sector and is
                        considered a significant contributor to the economy of this sector. Recent decades saw the
                        production and
                        commercialization of dahi and its related products by the organized sector. Recent research
                        works on
                        dahi has
                        increasingly focused on validating the nutritional and therapeutic benefits of dahi as well as
                        its
                        value addition
                        through incorporation of functional ingredients such as probiotics.

                            The United States is about to embark on an experiment inspired by one of the New Dealâ€™s
                            most popular programs. On
                            Wednesday, the Biden administration authorized the creation of the American Climate Corps
                            through an
                            executive order.
                            The program would hire 20,000 young people in its first year, putting them to work
                            installing
                            wind
                            and
                            solar projects,
                            making homes more energy-efficient, and restoring ecosystems like coastal wetlands to
                            protect
                            towns
                            from
                            flooding.

                            The idea has been in the works for years. It was first announced in President Joe Bidenâ€™s
                            early
                            days
                            in
                            the White House
                            in January 2021, tucked into a single paragraph in an executive order on tackling the
                            climate
                            crisis. At
                            the time, it
                            was called the Civilian Climate Corps â€” a reference to President Franklin D. Rooseveltâ€™s
                            Civilian
                            Conservation Corps,
                            launched in 1933 to help the country survive the Great Depression, which was responsible for
                            building
                            hundreds of parks,
                            including Great Smoky Mountains National Park, as well as many hiking trails and lodges you
                            can
                            find
                            across the country
                            today. Early versions of Bidenâ€™s trademark climate law that passed last year, the Inflation
                            Reduction
                            Act, included
                            money for reviving the CCC. But that funding got cut during negotiations last summer with
                            Senator
                            Joe
                            Manchin, a
                            Democrat from West Virginia, and the program was assumed dead.</p>

                            Yoga is a group of physical, mental, and spiritual practices or disciplines which originated
                            in
                            ancient India and aim to control (yoke)
                            and still the mind,
                            recognizing a detached witness-consciousness untouched by the mind (Chitta) and mundane
                            suffering (Duá¸¥kha). There is a
                            wide variety of schools of yoga, practices, and goals in Hinduism, Buddhism, and
                            Jainism,and traditional
                            and modern yoga is practiced worldwide.

                            Yoga-like practices were first mentioned in the ancient Hindu text known as Rigveda. Yoga is
                            referred to in a number
                            of the Upanishads. The first known appearance of the word "yoga" with the same meaning
                            as the modern term is
                            in the Katha Upanishad,which was probably composed between the fifth and third
                            centuries BCE. Yoga
                            continued to develop as a systematic study and practice during the fifth and sixth centuries
                            BCE
                            in ancient India's
                            ascetic and Åšramaá¹‡a movements.The most comprehensive text on Yoga, the Yoga Sutras of
                            Patanjali, date to the early
                            centuries of the Common Era; Yoga philosophy became known as one of the six
                            orthodox philosophical
                            schools (DarÅ›anas) of Hinduism in the second half of the first millennium CE.Hatha
                            yoga texts began to
                            emerge between the ninth and 11th centuries, originating in tantra.</p>
